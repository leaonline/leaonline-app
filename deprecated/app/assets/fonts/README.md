# Fixing the font file

If you encounter `SemikolonPlus-Regular.ttf` being missing then you are correct.
This is a special font, made for people with low literacy but we have no rights to pubish it
so we can't place it here.

In turn you can copy-paste the `OpenSans-Regular.ttf` and rename it to `SemikolonPlus-Regular.ttf`
in order to make things work from a functional perspective.
